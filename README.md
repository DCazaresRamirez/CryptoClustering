<h1>Cryptocurrency Clustering</h1>

<p>This project involves clustering cryptocurrencies using the K-Means algorithm. The analysis is performed on market data to identify patterns and group similar cryptocurrencies based on their features. The project includes data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and cluster evaluation.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data preprocessing and scaling to prepare the dataset for clustering.</li>
        <li>Optimization of the number of clusters (k) using the Elbow method with both original and PCA-reduced data.</li>
        <li>Visualization of clustering results using scatter plots with original and PCA-reduced data.</li>
        <li>Comparison of cluster results with and without PCA to analyze the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering performance.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> Programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Scikit-Learn:</strong> Python library for machine learning that includes implementations for K-Means clustering and PCA.</li>
        <li><strong>Pandas:</strong> Python library for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Matplotlib/Seaborn:</strong> Libraries for creating visualizations such as Elbow plots and scatter plots.</li>
    </ul>
